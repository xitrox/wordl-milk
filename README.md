# What the hell is this?

![Edinburgh Milk meme with a bragging wordle player](wordle.png)

This script has the sole purpose of combining [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) results with the [Milk Edinburgh meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/milk-edinburgh).

I made this for [@stormgrass](https://twitter.com/stormgrass) because he mentioned he wanted something like this in [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/stormgrass/status/1483820497246765058). 
Partly because I wanted to tinker around with this idea and party because I enjoy his [Podcast](https://www.geschichte.fm/) so much and wanted to make him happy with a little something.

# Installation
You need a working Python installation for this to work. Only the Pillow library is needed and can be installed via

    pip install -r requirements.txt
You can use any TrueType font you like. Either alter the script to your path or copy the corresponding .ttf-file into the main directory next to the script. I used Roboto-Regular which you can download from [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).


# Usage

    python wordle.py "Wordle 216 4/6

    â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
    ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
    ðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œ
    ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©"

If that doesn't work for you some reason you can also save the result in a file and pipe it like this:

    python wordle.py "$(cat result-example.txt)"
The output image is stored as wordle.png in this directory (and overwritten without confirmation so be careful!).
